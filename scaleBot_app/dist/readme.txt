-----------------------------------------------------
A small app here to help you practice your technique!
Made by Ethan Sengsavang
Commissioned by Zane Sereda

To use the program, use the "~Practice More~" button
to generate some new technique to practice! Or, if 
you're in a hurry, use the space bar to change what
technique you're practicing!

Want to add some new technique to practice? You can 
customize the technique selection with the included
technique choices in the "technique" folder, or
create your own selection of technique with the 
given template file.


                 ~About the program~
ScaleBot is currently not open-source, but will
be soon! Keep an eye on my GitHub account 
(www.github.com/e-seng) or on my website 
(e-seng.github.io)! For now, if there are any issues
with the program, email me with my email
(eth.sengsavang@gmail.com) and I'll patch it as soon
as I can.
