                  ~Using ScaleBot~
To use the program, use the "~Practice More~" button
to generate some new technique to practice! Or, if 
you're in a hurry, use the space bar to change what
technique you're practicing!

Want to add some new technique to practice? You can 
customize the technique selection with the included
technique choices in the "technique" folder, or
create your own selection of technique with the 
given template file.

Technique can be toggled on or off in the "Options"
menu. To focus on specific technique, toggle other
technique off, which is indicated by a selection 
highlight. Similarly, key centres can be set this
way under the "Keys" section. When loading new 
technique into ScaleBot, all technique will 
initially be set off and must be turned on to start
practicing.


                  ~About ScaleBot~
ScaleBot is currently not open-source, but will
be soon! Keep an eye on my GitHub account 
(www.github.com/e-seng) or on my website 
(e-seng.github.io) for any updates to Scalebot.
For now, if there are any issues with the program,
email at eth.sengsavang@gmail.com and I'll fix it as 
soon as I can. Thank you for using ScaleBot!
