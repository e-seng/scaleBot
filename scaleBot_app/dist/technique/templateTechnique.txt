+°~Some template for your technique~°+

###
###If you choose to ever make a custom technique sheet (which you could; I'm not going to 
###stop you), it is really important that you surround all of the different scales/chords
###in in each of their respective categories (like below). Also, it is important that the
###curly brackets ("{" and "}") are places in the same format as seen below. :)
###

chords:{
<<Add some chords here!>>
}
scales:{
<<Add some scales here!>>
}

<<unfortunately, other categories of technique cannot be added... yet!>>
